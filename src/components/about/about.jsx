            Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Jaeung Kim
          </span>
          <br></br>
          You can also call me <strong>Jae</strong> ðŸ™‚.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I am an ambitious, creative, and collaboriative software
          engineer with 2 years of experience in planning, developing,
          distributing, and maintaining software for startup companies. I
          primarily focuse on full-stack web development but I also have
          experiences working as a designer and product owners dependings on the
          needs of the company.

          When I work, I believe that actively communicating is one of the most
          important factors in making a big impact and being successful. Thus, I
          am always trying to engage in proactive communications among team
          members. And by doing so, I am able to grow as a better developer
          constantly.

          These days, during my free time, I love working on my 3D projects
          using latest 3D technologies like Three.js, WebGL and Blender.
