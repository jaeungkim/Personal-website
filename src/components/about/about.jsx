          Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Jaeung Kim, but I go by the name Jae. I am a
          full stack web developer with 2 years of working experience. I have
          planned, developed, distributed, and maintained software for startup
          companies.

          I believe that actively communicating is one of the most important
          factors in making a big impact in software development. Therefore, I
          love to engage in proactive communications among team members. By
          doing so, I am able to grow as a better developer constantly.
        </p>
        <p className="section-text">
          During my free time, I love exploring latest 3D technologies like
          Three.js, WebGL and Blender. In fact, this website was created using
          these technologies.
